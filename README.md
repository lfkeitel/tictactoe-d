# Tic-Tac-Toe in D

When learning a new language one of the first programs I write is a tic-tac-toe game with a very simple
AI. The game covers many core features such as arrays/slices, loops, functions, classes, and getting
user input.

This version can be played with one or two players. If one player is chosen, then an AI player will be
used as the second.

Feel free to look at the code, it's my first time writting D so be gentle.
